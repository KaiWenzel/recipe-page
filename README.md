## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Whenever you need to change a lot of different values to get a piece centered you most of the time have a knowledge gap and aren't using the right approach. But if it is the last polishing its very tempting to do so. Turned out quite responsive, but therefore it took way more time than it probably would've taken. 

### Continued development

In the following projects I would like to work more with tables again since I don't have much experience with them and during this project I ran into some difficulties. 

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - For CSS related questions.
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) - For identifying errors in your code.
